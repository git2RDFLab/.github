= GitLotus -- Git to RDF Web Service

GitLotus is a tool for extracting RDF data from Git repositories.

Git-based project data holds valuable insights beyond version control, including collaboration patterns and project management details. 
However, the heterogeneity of Git hosting platforms complicates unified analysis. 
GitLotus addresses this challenge by transforming Git repositories into RDF, enabling a structured and platform-independent representation. 
Hence, our approach is generating an easy-to-use bridge from the source code world to the semantic web; just like a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelumbo[Lotus flower] floats on a lake, GitLotus floats on Git data and creates new offsprings (views).
It extracts repository data via the Git protocol, integrates metadata from GitHub while handling API limitations, and exposes results through persistent SPARQL endpoints.

== Features

* Extracts Git repository data via the Git protocol
* Integrates metadata from GitHub while handling API limitations
* Exposes results through persistent SPARQL endpoints or as downloadable RDF/Turtle files

== Installation

GitLotus is a Docker-based application that can be installed on a server or a local machine via https://github.com/git2RDFLab/project-deployment-compose[Docker compose (for installation instructions see project-deployment-compose)] or as a standalone applications where four componnents need to be installed separately:

* https://github.com/git2RDFLab/ccr-listener-prototype[GitLotus listener service] for accepting Git repositories and providing status information
* https://github.com/git2RDFLab/ccr-worker-prototype[GitLotus worker service] for scheduling conversion of Git repositories to RDF files
* https://github.com/git2RDFLab/sparql-query-prototype[GitLotus SPARQL query endpoint] for querying the extracted RDF data from the different instances
* GitLotus data sink (we use by default a PostgreSQL database, but other data sinks can be used)

== RDF vocabulary

The GitLotus RDF vocabulary is available at https://github.com/git2RDFLab/[gitlotus-vocabulary].
